## What is Slap On?

Slappey is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that lets you generate a Discord.JS project in a matter of seconds.

## Why Slap On?

Slap on is very fast and uses the best command handler and event handler to give you the best discord performance.

## What Slappey is NOT

- Framework
- Library
- Discord Bot (It is a Discord Bot Project **generator**)
- Replacement for coding

# Getting Started

Download This repository and click press on the start.bat

- You need to have javascript version 16 or above installed for this to work [download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.1/node-v16.14.1-x64.msi)
- Press on the start.bat and click the first option to create you're bot. Follow the steps and enter your Bot Token and Prefix.
- Once done, `cd` into your project by typing `cd..` `cd <name of project>`
- To run the bot, type `npm run dev` or `npm start`. This will run the bot and if you are using the dev script it auto reloads on save

## Generating Commands

- To generate commands simply click on the start.bat in the **main** directory. Once done select the second option. Give you're command a name and a description and boom you're done. After that you want to go into the bot directory and into the commands folder and you're file will be there unless you do not give it a file name.

## Generating Events

- To generate events simply click on the start.bat in the **main** directory. Once done select the thrid option. Select the event you want and you're file will get created in the events folder in the bot's directory. Event files do not take in param uppon creation as of right now, you will have to add the params manualy.


## Warning
- If you try to create events / commands without a project the tool will crash.
