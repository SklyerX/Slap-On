# how to make events
- if you want to use the easier method click on the start.bat and select option 3. Option 3 will give a list of all the events possible at this time. Select the event you wish and go into the bot directory and click on the folder named "events" in the events folder you can see the newly created event file.

# NOTE:
- The bot does not pass params in the event as some users like to change the command and event handler to their preference. You have to pass in the param yourself until further updates.
